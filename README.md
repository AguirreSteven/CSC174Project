CSC 174 Final Project

https://ecs-pw-proj-web.ecs.csus.edu/~stevenaguirre/Library.php

The MySQL code that generates our tables can be found at: https://github.com/AguirreSteven/CSC174Project/blob/main/MySQL%20Tables

Library.php contains code that will connect to the database and insert the user's name derived from the textbox value and add it to the Member table.
